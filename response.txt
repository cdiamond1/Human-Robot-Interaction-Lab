Certainly, Dave. Wound care involves steps taken to ensure that a wound heals correctly. ^start(animations/Stand/Gestures/Explaining_1)

The most important part of wound care is to keep the wound clean, meaning you should gently cleanse the area with mild soap and water. This prevents infection by removing any dirt or debris from the wound.

After cleaning, it’s important to apply an antibiotic ointment if available, followed by a clean dressing or bandage. This helps to protect the wound from further injury and harmful bacteria.

It is essential to change the dressing regularly, always keeping the wound moist for effective healing. 

Lastly, you should also be aware of signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus.

This is a basic overview. Depending on the wound, care can be quite complex.
