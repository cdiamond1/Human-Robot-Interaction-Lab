Basic wound care involves cleaning, protecting, and monitoring a wound. First, wash your hands and cleanse the wound with gentle soap and water. After cleaning, apply an antibiotic ointment if available, then cover it with a clean bandage or dressing. It's important to change the dressing daily, or when it becomes wet or dirty. While caring for the wound, keep an eye out for any signs of infection like increased pain, redness, pus, or swelling. 

I hope this helps, Steve. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
